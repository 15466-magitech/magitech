<:>text_town_entrance_m

The sign above the town's entrance seems like it's in bad shape,
 and it may be missing some letters. It currently looks like it reads Pain Point.

The door is locked, please try typing open sesame in the terminal.

<:>text_big_bucket

The artist made this world, then left.
<:>text_easel

This painting is missing its purple tones.
<:>text_bridge

The water here doesn't look real - it's an illusion. An illusion of water...
<:>text_white_house

The artist made the bridge a long time ago. We don't know why that sign's there, but maybe it has to do with the paintbrush.
<:>text_platform

You won!
<:>text_small_bucket

There's something up there...
<:>text_corner

(You can tell there was writing on this sign, but it's unintelligible now.)
