<:>text_yellow_house

The sign above the town's entrance seems like it's in bad shape,
 and it may be missing some letters. It currently looks like it reads Pain Point.
<:>text_spaceship_m

The door is locked, please try open sesame
<:>text_big_bucket

The artist made this world, then left.
<:>text_easel

This painting is missing its purple tones.
<:>text_bridge

The water here doesn't look real - it's an illusion. An illusion of water...
<:>text_white_house

The artist made the bridge a long time ago. We don't know why that sign's there, but maybe it has to do with the paintbrush.
<:>text_platform

You won!
<:>text_small_bucket

There's something up there...
<:>text_corner

(You can tell there was writing on this sign, but it's unintelligible now.)
